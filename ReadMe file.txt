Program Start:

The application starts in the main method of the BudgetPlanner class.
The first step is to create a Scanner object to handle user input from the console.
User Input for Income:

The user is prompted to enter their gross monthly income. This value is stored in the grossIncome variable.
Estimated Tax Input:

Next, the user is asked to enter the estimated monthly tax deducted, which is also captured for later calculations.
Monthly Expenditures Input:

The user is prompted to enter their estimated monthly expenditures across various categories:
Groceries
Water and lights
Travel costs
Cell phone and telephone
Other expenses
Each input is stored in separate variables and can be summed later to determine total monthly expenses.
Accommodation Decision:

The user is asked whether they would like to rent or buy a property. The input is case-insensitive.
If the user chooses to rent, they are prompted to enter the monthly rental amount. This is added to the list of expenses.
If they choose to buy a property, they are prompted to enter:
Purchase price of the property
Total deposit
Interest rate (as a percentage)
Number of months to repay the loan (between 240 and 360 months)
A HomeLoan object is created using the entered data, which calculates the monthly repayment amount using a method inside the HomeLoan class.
Loan Approval Check:

If the calculated monthly repayment for the home loan exceeds one-third of the user's gross income, a warning message is displayed, indicating that loan approval is unlikely.
Vehicle Purchase Option:

The user is then asked if they wish to buy a vehicle. If they respond with "yes", they are prompted to enter:
Vehicle purchase price
Total deposit
Interest rate (percentage)
Estimated insurance premium
A VehicleLoan object is created, which combines the insurance and loan repayment costs into one expense that is added to the expenses list.
Calculate Available Monthly Money:

The application calculates the available monthly money by subtracting total expenses (including tax and loan repayments) from the gross income.
This value is displayed to the user.
Expense Limit Warning:

If the total expenses (including loan repayments) exceed 75% of the gross income, the user receives a warning about their spending.
Display Expenses:

The program sorts all recorded expenses in descending order based on their amount and prints them to the console, allowing the user to see where their money is going.
Code Execution Steps
Here’s a concise step-by-step breakdown of the execution:

Initialization: The program initializes necessary variables and collections to hold user input data.
Input Handling: It uses a loop of prompts to gather user input, validating as necessary (though basic in this implementation).
Calculations: It calculates loan repayments and available money based on user inputs.
Conditional Logic: It uses conditions to provide warnings based on the user's financial data (e.g., loan approval likelihood and expense limits).
Output: Finally, it displays results and sorted expenses to the user.
